A small script to control the theme of `vim`, `zsh`, and `iTerm2`.

## Motivation

I frequently work with varying levels of sunlight, so I find myself frequently switching themes.

## Usage

Add the `$VIM_THEME` and `$VIM_AIRLINE_THEME` to your `.vimrc` or `init.vim` file. `ZSH` themes are changed using the built in environment variable, so you should be covered. There is also an `iTerm2` escape hook in here that I can't seem to get working, so PRs are welcome.
